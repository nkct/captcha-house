# captcha-house

Have you ever wanted to just solve captchas?  
Do you look at them and a dark desire within you grows?  
But those damnn websites only let you solve one or two!  
And then you have to refresh the page or even clear browser data to do them again!  

Well... that used to be me.  
But I couldn't take it anymore.  
And I took matters into my own hands.  

I present to you:  
**CAPTCHA House!**  
Where you can endlessly solve captchas for however long you please!  
You could spend your entire life in here.  

At least in concept, for now it remains grossly unfinished.  

All of the CAPTCHA service providers, that I have seen, don't quite offer what I'm looking for. Requiring API keys and accounts, all while harvesting your data and limiting access rates.  
So I have decided to build my own CAPTCHAs. They are unsecure and completely unusable for any actuall bot prevention needs.  
This is meant purely as a proggraming challange with a flair of humour.  

this goes without saying but, **Do not attempt to use this to secure your website.**  

## Usage
This will one day be hosted as a website, but untill that day, you have to build it by yourself.
